# Computer-Systems
Covers how programs are represented and executed by modern computers, including low-level machine representations of programs and data, an understanding of how computer components and the memory hierarchy influence performance. 

## Data Lab
Covers bit arithmetic and bit masking. Please look at test.c for my code

## Performance Lab
Covers optimization via loop unrolling, spacial locality and memory hiearchy. Look at FilterMain.cpp for my code.
